In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Simple application where one can switch modes from dark to light and opposite.
Tech stack used: JS, ReactJS, localStorage.(avoid to get back to default mode after refreshing the page, data is stored in local storage)

Mode works OK, I wil try to build it up with other components. /04.12.22/
